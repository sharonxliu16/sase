Hi! First off, congratulations on being elected onto Eboard! This code will help you randomly generate concessions games to ensure fairness of the games each person is assigned, since nobody wants to work white out (obviously). Additionally, it ensures that each person will be assigned 3 different games.

The only thing you need to do is change the names for the current executive board before running the code. You can just run this in repl.it as a guest, and it will work fine. 

NOTE: This code only works in the case that SASE is working for 6 games, since usually one game (the homecoming one) is during National Conference. However, if we are working more or less games than 6, then you must adjust the code as well.
